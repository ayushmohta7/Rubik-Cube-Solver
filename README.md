# Rubiks Cube Solver
## Overview
This project implements a Rubik's Cube solver using BFS, DFS, IDDFS, A*, and Korf's IDA* algorithms. The solver efficiently finds the shortest solution for scrambled cubes, utilizing heuristic optimizations like pattern databases to enhance performance and reduce computation time
